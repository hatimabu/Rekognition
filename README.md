This project analyzes images uploaded to S3 with Amazon Rekognition, and if faces are detected, records the results in DynamoDB and notifies users via SNS.

# Architecture Workflow

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Image Upload (S3)

+ A user uploads an image from their computer into an Amazon S3 bucket.

+ The bucket is configured with event notifications so that whenever a new image is uploaded, it automatically triggers the AWS Lambda function.

### üí∞ *pricing*
S3 Standard - General purpose storage for any type of data, typically used for frequently accessed data	
First 50 TB / Month	$0.023 per GB

##### Requests & data retrievals 
- PUT, COPY, POST, LIST requests $0.005/per 1,000 requests
- GET, SELECT, and all other request $0.0004/per 1,000 requests
###### TOTAL
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ S3 Storage

15,000 images √ó 0.5 MB = 7,500 MB = 7.5 GB stored per month.
Pricing (S3 Standard): $0.023 per GB
Cost: 7.5 √ó $0.023 = $0.1725 ‚âà $0.18 per month

- 2Ô∏è‚É£ S3 Requests

PUT (uploads) = 15,000 / 1,000 √ó $0.005 = $0.075
GET (retrieval by Rekognition) = 15,000 / 1,000 √ó $0.0004 = $0.006
Total = $0.081 ‚âà $0.08 per month

## üßÆ Processing (Lambda + Rekognition)

+ Lambda function is invoked when the new object (image) is created in S3.

```hcl
const AWS = require("aws-sdk");

// Initialize AWS clients
const rekognition = new AWS.Rekognition();
const dynamoDB = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    try {
        // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Get S3 info from event (triggered when file uploaded to S3)
        const bucket = event.Records[0].s3.bucket.name;
        const key = decodeURIComponent(event.Records[0].s3.object.key.replace(/\+/g, " "));

        console.log(`New image uploaded: ${bucket}/${key}`);

        // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Call Rekognition to analyze the image
        const rekogParams = {
            Image: {
                S3Object: {
                    Bucket: bucket,
                    Name: key
                }
            },
            Attributes: ["ALL"]  // detect emotions, age, gender, etc.
        };

        const rekogResult = await rekognition.detectFaces(rekogParams).promise();

        console.log("Rekognition result:", JSON.stringify(rekogResult, null, 2));

        // 3Ô∏è‚É£ Extract some useful data (example: face count + top emotion)
        const faceDetails = rekogResult.FaceDetails || [];
        const faceCount = faceDetails.length;
        let topEmotion = "NONE";

        if (faceCount > 0 && faceDetails[0].Emotions.length > 0) {
            // Pick the most confident emotion
            topEmotion = faceDetails[0].Emotions.reduce((prev, curr) =>
                prev.Confidence > curr.Confidence ? prev : curr
            ).Type;
        }

        // 4Ô∏è‚É£ Save results to DynamoDB
        const dbParams = {
            TableName: "ImageAnalysis",
            Item: {
                ImageId: `${bucket}/${key}`,
                Timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
                FaceCount: faceCount,
                TopEmotion: topEmotion,
                RawData: rekogResult   // optional: store full JSON response
            }
        };

        await dynamoDB.put(dbParams).promise();
        console.log(`Saved analysis for ${key} to DynamoDB`);

        return { statusCode: 200, body: "Success" };

    } catch (err) {
        console.error("Error processing image:", err);
        throw err;
    }
};
```

### üí∞ *pricing*
 The Lambda free tier includes 1M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.

+ Inside the Lambda function, you call Amazon Rekognition.

+ Rekognition analyzes the uploaded image and checks whether it contains faces.

---

## Decision Making

+ If no face is detected ‚Üí nothing happens (or you can log it).

+ If a face is detected:

 + The Lambda function writes the metadata (image name, S3 path, number of faces, confidence score, etc.) into a DynamoDB table.
 + The Lambda function also triggers Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) to send an email notification (or SMS/push, depending on configuration).

---

## Notification

+ SNS publishes the message to all subscribers.

For example, if you configured email, the subscriber receives an email saying something like:

"A face has been detected in the uploaded image: [filename]."
